NOTES ON UPGRADING FROM 027 codes or 024s13a,b,c
================================================
(For other codes see lower down)

Code 029 uses a newer version of Megatune which has stricter error
checking than earlier versions. You may need to re-edit settings.ini
and custom.ini to get rid of these errors. If you don't fancy manual
edits then rename your car1 folder before installing Megatune 2.25
(See the 024s13 notes for this)

The biggest change in 029 from earlier codes is a change in memory layout.
To avoid retyping all your settings you can use Megatune to write an
XML format MSQ file. These settings will read into the new code with
little or no retyping.

So, before upgrading your firmware, create an XML format MSQ as follows.

1. Make SURE you have saved your Megasquirt settings using your
existing version of Megatune.
File->Save in Megatune. Keep that "MSQ" file safe.
Take a print of the Warmup Wizard settings as these will not be transferred.

2. Rename you existing car1 folder
Open up Windows Explorer,
Navigate to C:\Program Files\Megasquirt
Right click on car1
Rename
Name it car1old

3. Download and install Megatune2.25 from
http://not2fast.wryday.com/megasquirt/mt/2.25/mt225_setup.exe
This should create a new car1 folder
Note! If you have problems with Megatune crashing "sorry there was an
error" during startup, see the Megatune subforum of msefi.com
(One fix I found on XP was to move the Megasquirt directory somewhere
else instead of "Program Files" e.g. c:\efi if you do this you will
need to create new shortcuts.)

4. Use the MtCfg programme to edit your car1/settings.ini
Enable the MSNS_EXTRA code and setup degC, degF and your oxygen
sensor.
This is the same as you will have done when first installing Extra.
(optionally you can hand edit)

5. While still in MtCfg, see if there is a matching ini file listed for
you existing firmware, if there is then
File->Activate it.

6. Exit Mtcfg and run Megatune.

7. If all is well MT should open up without any errors.

8. Load in the MSQ you saved in step 1.

9. Check a few settings to make sure it is ok.

10. File-> Save As with a new name. This should be a new format XML file.
10a. Load and save any other MSQs you want to transfer.
10b. Edit these new files with notepad and use search->find to find the
     string "wueBins5", replace it with "wueBins9"

11. Now proceed to upgrade the firmware, double click on download-firmware

12. Double click on copyini.bat
(this copies the correct msns-extra.ini file over to Megatune)
 Or use MtCfg to activate msns-extra.ini.029XX (not there yet)

13. Open up Megatune

14. Load in the MSQ you saved in step 10.

15. Re-type your warmup wizard settings.

16. Check check and check your settings. If you have any/many missing
    settings please post on the MSnS-extra forum.


NOTES ON UPGRADING FROM pre 024 codes such as 021u3
==============================================================

Upgrading is a little more involved as the memory layout was changed.
Your best approach is to export the spark and fuel tables File->Export
within the table. Save these for all your tables.
Then do the install of the firmware and Megatune.
Open up Megatune with the MS connected and import your fuel and spark
tables. The other settings will need to be keyed in.

You may be able to follow a similar procedure to the above step above
if the new Megatune release has an ini file to match your firmware version.
